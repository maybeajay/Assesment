Steps to run the web app
In the IDE most probably VS Code
open up two terminals one is for React 
in the second terminal run this command json-server  db2.json -p 8080 
make sure to copy paste above command
now run npm start we can use CRUD operation on the web app 
Tech Stack I am using
React JS + Tailwind 
Redux and RTK Query for the api related stuff
Country State City Api for getting users location details
JSON Server for creating Fake Restful APi's
